## About.

Hey, I am Okiki Ojo (pronounced O-key-key O-jo), Iâ€™m a student currently studying Software Engineering at [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca/) (formerly University of Ontario Institute of Technology, UOIT). From a very young age, I've always been interested in tech, and science. Initially, I started web development out of curiosity, eventually it became a hobby, and after many hobby projects (e.g. Open Source projects; read more in [featured projects](#featured-projects)), I thought it would be cool to offer my skills to clients who want awesome web experiences, thus here we are.  
  
I have a passion for design and development, I like to create things that donâ€™t just look good, but that also function on multiple levels. I am always eager to take on a challenge, and aim to exceed in all tasks I take on. I develop websites that are functional, efficient and that act as an excellent representation of a person or business on the digital landscape. I have 5+ years of experience designing sites, I would love to bring your digital vision to reality.

### Experience

While working on my hobby projects, I tried my hands at Open Source development. Open source development (OSS), taught me quite a lot, for one it made me truly appreciate good governance, and even better coding/documentation practices. During my adventures in OSS, I worked on many projects, ranging from [@okikio/animate](https://native.okikio.dev/animate) to [bundle.js.org](https://bundle.js.org) (learn more at [featured projects](#projects) ), wrote multiple [blog posts](https://blog.okikio.dev/) and [articles](https://css-tricks.com/how-i-used-the-waapi-to-build-an-animation-library/) , I even earned a position as a [maintainer](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild/status/1486195466085695488?s=20&t=P7aMtK25Hg0DlWpIF3PC7w) on the [astro.build](https://astro.build) project. All the experience gained from OSS is a great asset to me, and I am very grateful for it, I aim to use this experience to build better web experiences, better UI/UX, and to find new creative ways to craft online experiences for my clients.

### Skills

I have experience in Astro, Javascript, Typescript, CSS/SASS, HTML, Pug, Node.js, Fastify, Pjax, Solid.js, Svelte, C#, C++, and moreâ€¦ I prefer to learn skills as I need them, so I can focus on finding solutions to problems instead of trying to implement new technologies for the sake of implementing them.

### Method

When developing sites I first aim to understand the needs and goals of the project, I then determine the best approach to build a site. There are four parts to my method, speed, efficiency, ease-of-use, and impact.

### Speed

How quickly the client wants their website, and accordingly what tools will ensure high levels of speed.

### Efficiency

Making sure not to waste resources, time and/or effort, so users can get the most out of the final product.

### Ease-of-use

The site needs to be easy to use, easy enough so users can navigate through the site without breaking a sweat.

### Impact

As the representation of you or your business online, the site should leave an impact that encourages users to visit again.
