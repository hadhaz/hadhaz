## About.

Hey, I am Okiki Ojo (pronounced O-key-key O-jo), I’m a student currently studying Software Engineering at [Ontario Tech University](https://ontariotechu.ca/) (formerly University of Ontario Institute of Technology, UOIT). I enjoy design and development, I like to create things that don’t just look good, but that also function. I am always eager to take on new challenges, and aim to exceed in all tasks I take on. 

### Experience

Open source development (OSS), has taught me quite a lot, for one it made me truly appreciate good governance, and even better coding/documentation practices. During my adventures in OSS, I worked on many projects, ranging from [@okikio/animate](https://native.okikio.dev/animate) to [bundle.js.org](https://bundle.js.org) (learn more at [featured projects](#projects)), wrote multiple [blog posts](https://blog.okikio.dev/) and [articles](https://css-tricks.com/how-i-used-the-waapi-to-build-an-animation-library/), I even earned a position as a [maintainer](https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild/status/1486195466085695488?s=20&t=P7aMtK25Hg0DlWpIF3PC7w) on the [astro.build](https://astro.build) project. All the experience gained from OSS has been truly helpful, I aim to use this experience to build better projects, better UI/UX, and better sites.

### Skills

I have experience in Astro, Javascript, Typescript, CSS/SASS, HTML, Pug, Node.js, Fastify, Pjax, Solid.js, Svelte, C#, C++, and more… I prefer to learn skills as I need them, so I can focus on finding solutions to problems instead of trying to implement new technologies for the sake of implementing them.
