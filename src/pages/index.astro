      <p>
        Hey, I am Hadzami, I’m a student
        studying Computer Science at <Anchor href="https://ugm.ac.id"
        >Universitas Gadjah Mada</Anchor
        >, who is currently working as a Software Engineer Intern at <Anchor href="https://suitmedia.com/"
        >Suitmedia</Anchor>. From a
        very young age, I've always been interested in tech, and science. Initially,
        I started web development out of curiosity, eventually it became a hobby,
        and after many hobby projects (e.g. Open Source projects; read more in <Anchor
          href="#projects">featured projects</Anchor
        >), I thought it would be cool to offer my skills to clients who want
        awesome web experiences, thus here we are.

        <br />
        <br />

        I have a passion for design and development, I like to create things
        that don’t just look good, but that also function on multiple levels. I
        am always eager to take on a challenge, and aim to exceed in all tasks I
        take on. I develop websites that are functional, efficient and that act
        as an excellent representation of a person or business on the digital
        landscape. I have 5+ years of experience designing sites, I would love
        to bring your digital vision to reality.

      <p>
        While working on my hobby projects, I tried my hands at Open Source
        development. Open source development (<span
          class="fine:underline fine:decoration-dotted"
          title="Technically OSS should be OSSD as in Open Source Software Development, but tomato, tomahato (intentional)"
          >OSS</span
        >), taught me quite a lot, for one it made me truly appreciate good
        governance, and even better coding/documentation practices. During my
        adventures in OSS, I worked on many projects, ranging from <Anchor
          href="https://native.okikio.dev/animate">@okikio/animate</Anchor
        > to <Anchor href="https://bundlejs.com">bundlejs.com</Anchor> (learn more
        at <Anchor href="#projects">featured projects</Anchor>), wrote multiple <Anchor
          href="https://blog.okikio.dev/">blog posts</Anchor
        > and <Anchor
          href="https://css-tricks.com/how-i-used-the-waapi-to-build-an-animation-library/"
          >articles</Anchor
        >, I even earned a position as a <Anchor
          href="https://twitter.com/astrodotbuild/status/1486195466085695488?s=20&t=P7aMtK25Hg0DlWpIF3PC7w"
          >maintainer</Anchor
        > on the <Anchor href="https://astro.build">astro.build</Anchor> project.
        All the experience gained from OSS is a great asset to me, and I am very
        grateful for it, I aim to use this experience to build better web experiences,
        better UI/UX, and to find new creative ways to craft online experiences for
        my clients.

        I have experience in Next JS, Javascript, Typescript, CSS/SASS, HTML, Astro JS,
        Node.js, Kotlin, ASP.NET and more… I prefer to
        learn skills as I need them, so I can focus on finding solutions to
        problems instead of trying to implement new technologies for the sake of
        implementing them.

      <h3 id="method">Method</h3>
      <p>
        When developing sites I first aim to understand the needs and goals of
        the project, I then determine the best approach to build a site. There
        are four parts to my method, speed, efficiency, ease-of-use, and impact.
