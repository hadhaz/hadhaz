# Privacy Policy
## What we do with your data
Hello there! Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. We aim to collect only what we absolutely need and nothing more. 

We handle your information carefully and abide by Canadian laws (like PIPEDA), as well as the GDPR (for our European friends) and the CCPA (for our California pals). You're in safe hands with us.

## 1. Data we collect and why
For any product we create for a customer, we may need some information. This could include your name, email address, and specific details about the product. We keep this information confidential and only ask for what we need to serve you better.

We also collect some data about how visitors use our products. For this, we use a self-hosted version of [Umami](https://umami.is). This tool gives us insights into our product usage in the most privacy-friendly way possible, keeping data anonymous and aggregate. We do this to continually improve our products and business.

## 2. TypeScript Code Analyzer REST API
When you use our TypeScript Code Analyzer REST API, we don't store any of the code you send for analysis. The code is processed for the purpose of providing analysis results and is not stored, shared, or used for any other purpose. 

## 3. How we protect your data
Your data's security is our priority. We use secure servers, and all data transferred between your browser and our server is encrypted. It's like a secret handshake that keeps your data safe from prying eyes.

## 4. Who we share data with
We don't believe in sharing your data with anyone else. Unless we're obliged to by law, your data stays strictly between you and us. 

## 5. Your rights
Under Canadian law, GDPR, and CCPA, you have rights regarding your personal data. You can ask us what information we hold about you, request corrections to it, and even ask us to stop using it. If you're not satisfied with how we're handling your data, tell us and we'll do our best to set things right.

## 6. Updates to this policy
Just as websites need updates, so does this policy from time to time. If we make any changes, we'll let you know right here. By continuing to use our services, you're saying you're okay with any updates.

## 7. Let's chat
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or how we handle your data, don't hesitate to reach out to us at [privacy&#64;okikio.dev](mailto:privacy&#64;okikio.dev). We're here to help!

This Privacy Policy is governed by Canadian law, with respect to GDPR and CCPA principles.
