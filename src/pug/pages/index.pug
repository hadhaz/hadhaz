      | Hey, I am Okiki Ojo (pronounced O-ke-ke O-jo), I'm a student currently studying Software Engineering at Ontario Tech University (formerly University of Ontario Institute of Technology, UOIT). I have a passion for design and development, I like to create things that don't only look good but that also function on multiple devices. I am always eager to take on a challenge. I develop websites that are functional, efficient and that act as an excellent representation of a person or business on the digital landscape. I have a 4+ years of experience designing sites, I would love to bring your digital vision to reality.

      h4.sub-section-title.mt-16 Skills
      | I have experience in Javascript, Typescript, CSS/Sass/SCSS, HTML, Pug, Node.js, Fastify, Pjax, C#, C++, and more... I prefer to learn skills as I need them, so I can focus on finding solutions to problems instead of trying to implement new technologies for the sake of implementing them.

      h4.sub-section-title.mt-16 Method
      | When developing sites I first aim to understand the needs and goals of the project, I then determine the best approach to build a site. There are four parts to my method, speed, efficiency, ease-of-use, and impact.
